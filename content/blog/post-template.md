<!-- IMPORTANT: Keep code first, then write the description. Do not add content after the description. -->

```ts
// Replace this with a minimal, runnable example that the description will explain.
// Keep the snippet focused and self-contained.
```

Write 250–500 words here explaining the snippet above.

Suggestions for the description:
- What problem this solves and why it matters.
- How the snippet works step by step (focus on key lines only).
- Common pitfalls, trade‑offs, or alternatives and why this approach was chosen.
- When to use it (and when not to).

Keep paragraphs short (2–4 sentences each). Aim for clarity, not exhaustiveness.
